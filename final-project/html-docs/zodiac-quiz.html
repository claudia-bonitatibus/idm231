				Once upon a time, when magical beings still roamed the land and inhabited the seas, when the rules of the earth were determined by four distinct elements – water, fire, wind, and terra –  in a small picturesque farming village located on the fringes of a lush forest there lived a child.  For decades, even centuries, the people of the village were contented, one might even say they were complacent. For there was much unpredictability in the outside world and their surroundings had a reputation of being particularly mercurial. But when this child, who would come to be widely known as 
				<input type="text" id= "firstName" placeholder="First name"> 
				of <input type="text" id= "lastName" placeholder="Last name">, was born on <input type="date" id="date" placeholder="mm/dd/yyyy"> that attitude changed.

			<div class = "pageTwo">
				Throughout childhood the villager was intrigued by adventure and all of the unseen truths lying just out of reach, calling out to be uncovered. While the sheltered life may have its merits, what the child sook was something that the quaint village did not have to offer. The villager did lead a subdued existence for some time but eventually decided to pack their bags and head out into the outside world to see for certain what they had only heard about from tales of old.
